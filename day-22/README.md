# 🏓 Pong Game
This is a simple Pong-style paddle game built using Python's Turtle graphics module. The player controls a paddle to bounce a moving ball and prevent it from passing their side. It's a great project to demonstrate your understanding of object-oriented programming, collision detection, and basic game loops.

## 🎮 Features
- Player paddle controlled with keyboard (Up/Down keys)
- Ball that bounces off walls and paddles
- Score tracking for both players
- Game ends when a player reaches the winning score
- Clean object-oriented code with separate classes for Paddle, Ball, and Scoreboard

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Object-Oriented Programming in Python
- Using Turtle module for game development
- Handling keyboard input and screen updates
- Writing reusable classes (Paddle, Ball, Scoreboard)
