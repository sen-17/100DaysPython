# 🃏 Blackjack - Terminal Game in Python

Welcome to **Blackjack**, a simple terminal-based card game built using Python.  
This project simulates the classic game where you play against a dealer and try to get as close to 21 as possible without busting.

---

## 🎮 How to Play

- You start with 2 random cards.
- The dealer also draws 2 cards, but only 1 is shown at first.
- You can choose to:
  - **Draw another card** (`Hit`)
  - **Stop drawing** (`Stand`)
- If your total exceeds 21, you lose (`Bust`).
- Once you stand, the dealer draws until reaching at least 17.
- The winner is decided based on who has the higher total without exceeding 21.

## 🛠 Features

- Random card drawing from a virtual deck
- Player and dealer turns
- Bust and Blackjack detection
- Game loop with replay option
- Clean and modular code structure
- ASCII logo for flair ✨
