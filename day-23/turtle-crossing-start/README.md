# 🐢 Turtle Crossing Game (Capstone Project)

This is a simple **arcade-style game** built with Python's `turtle` module as the **capstone project** for Day 23 of the #100DaysCode challenge. Inspired by the classic "Frogger" game, the objective is to help the turtle cross the road while dodging speeding cars!

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- The player controls a turtle that starts at the bottom of the screen.
- The goal is to reach the top without getting hit by a car.
- Cars move horizontally across the screen and increase in speed each level.
- Every successful crossing levels up the game and speeds up the cars.
- If the turtle collides with a car, the game ends.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Class-based design (`Player`, `CarManager`, `Scoreboard`)
- Collision detection
- Game loop and animation
- Event listeners with `turtle.listen()`
- Dynamic difficulty scaling

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3
- **Graphics**: Turtle Graphics module (standard library)

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the project folder.
3. Run the game with:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add sound effects
- Add multiple lives
- Implement obstacles or bonuses
- Create a start menu and pause feature
