# 🐍 Snake Game - Python Turtle Project

This is a classic **Snake Game** built with Python using the `turtle` graphics module. It was developed as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge — **Day 20**, where I practiced **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, class structure, and game logic in Python.

## 🚀 Features
- Fully playable Snake game with arrow key controls.
- Snake grows when it eats food.
- Score is displayed and increases on food collision.
- Game ends when snake hits wall or itself.
- Clean structure using Python classes (`Snake`, `Food`, and `Score`).

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Creating classes and managing object states.
- Detecting collisions using `.distance()`.
- Using `turtle.Screen()` and `tracer()` for smooth animations.
- Implementing game loops and basic state management.

## 🎮 Controls
Use your keyboard to play:

- 🠕 Up Arrow
- 🠗 Down Arrow
- 🠔 Left Arrow
- 🠖 Right Arrow

## 💻 Requirements
Only the standard Python library is used:
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```
